### 🛠️ What I Worked On:

1. **Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression & Naïve Bayes**  
   _Classified tweets to determine positive or negative sentiment using two classic ML techniques._

2. **Vector Space Models & PCA for Word Relationships**  
   _Explored relationships between words using word embeddings and applied **PCA** to reduce dimensionality and visualize them._

3. **English-to-French Translation with Word Embeddings**  
   _Built a simple translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and **locality-sensitive hashing** (LSH) for approximate k-nearest neighbor search._
