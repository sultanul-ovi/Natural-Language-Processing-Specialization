# Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization
Coursera DeepLearning.AI Specialization on Natural Language Processing (4 courses)
## 🧠 Specialization: 4-Course Series on NLP 🚀

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is the intersection of linguistics, computer science, and AI, transforming unstructured text into meaningful data through cutting-edge algorithms.

### 🌟 What You'll Learn:
- Build models for **sentiment analysis** and **question-answering**.
- Create tools for **language translation**, **text summarization**, and even **chatbots**.
- Harness the power of **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques.

### 🏗️ Applied Learning Project:
1. **Logistic Regression** & **Naïve Bayes**: Sentiment analysis, analogies, language translation, and nearest neighbors.
2. **Hidden Markov Models** & **Embeddings**: Autocorrect, autocomplete, and POS tagging.
3. **RNNs** & **Siamese Networks**: Advanced text generation, duplicate question detection.
4. **Attention Mechanisms**: Chatbots, question-answering, and BERT-like models with 🤗.
